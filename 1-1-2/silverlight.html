<p>The objective of this technique is to replace a Silverlight MediaElement with static alternative non-media content that is not time-based. The static alternative content replaces the media in the same or a nearby user interface region of the Silverlight application.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the media being played is audio-only, and the alternative content is a text equivalent such as a transcript, this technique addresses Success Criterion 1.2.1 (Audio-only and Video-only, Prerecorded).</li>
  <li>If the media includes content that cannot be adequately described by either alternative audio track or additional text captions, and the best alternative is to provide a full description in text such as a screenplay of the content, this technique addresses Success Criterion 1.2.3 (Audio Description or Full Text Alternative) and is similar to G69: Providing an alternative for time based media.</li>
</ul>

<p>A Silverlight application user interface can be adjusted at run time by removing elements from the visual tree, and adding new elements to the visual tree. In this case, the user interface is designed to provide a control that the user activates to display the static alternative content, which is often a control that displays text, or a text element.</p>

<h3>Example 1: MediaElement playing audio, replace with transcript</h3>
<p>This example has a UI definition in XAML and interaction logic in C#. In this case the MediaElement has no visual representation itself and is 0x0 size because it plays audio only. As a simple placeholder, this example displays the text "Library of Congress Audio" to represent the media element as something visible in the UI. In addition to Play/Stop controls, this interface includes a Display Transcript button. Activating the button displays static text that represents the transcript of the audio. The following is the basic UI in XAML.</p>

<div class="codeContainer"><pre><code>&lt;UserControl x:Class="ReplaceAudioWithTranscriptText.MainPage"

For the first time in the festival's nine year history, President Barack Obama and
First Lady Michelle Obama will serve as honorary chairs of this free event. &lt;/sys:String&gt;
